# osu!online

## ðŸ“° About the project
An Osu! client that can run in your browser!

## ðŸ”§ Setup

_If you want to try out the project, here are the steps you will have to follow._

1. Clone the repo :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/clay53/osu-online.git
```
2. Install Live server for VS code :

There are multiple ways you can open a static web page locally. However, I would recommend to install the [Live server extension on VS code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) because of it's simplicity.

**Once that is done, open the folder where the project is located.**
> You could do it like this if still in the CLI :
```sh
cd osu-online
code .
```
Otherwise, you can just proeed manually.

3. Launch the project locally

On the bottom right part of your vs code you should see this :

Just click on the `Go Live` button and open http://localhost:5500/ in your browser.

4. Preview an Osu! map

Once your project is launched, download **any** `.osz map file` and click on `select a file` on top of the page.

You will then be able to click on the circle and map select and the preview of the song will begin.
